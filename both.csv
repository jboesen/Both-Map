For instance, Archie Bunker has a typical Irish Catholic Brooklyn accent, very strange for a supposedly Queens Protestant, while on the other hand, Edith Bunker has a typical eastern Queens accent where the distinction between Protestant and Catholic is difficult. My own accent is from living in one of the last pockets of English and Scottish settlers in southeast Queens(and from radio and television, I suppose). It is a minority neighborhood now.
In fact, many of these neighborhoods are no more, in the sense that they have either become black, hispanic or gentrified neighborhoods today.  My point: I imagine that at one time almost any conceivable mispronunciation of the language existed in NYC and it is probably necessary, when dealing with the city to get locale information and date of birth. Those who were born before 1960 will show a greater variation in accent and pronunciation than those born after. "

Most importantly, I spotted your notes on my lifelong hero of words:  William Safire. Who single-handedly brought me from my backwoods upbringing to a more sophisticated reader and writer today.

His column was featured in the Raleigh-Register out of Beckley WV when I was a child and always read that first, even before the funnies! Anyway, he mentioned another one of my favorite columnist, Jack Anderson one time, which cemented our friendship even greater. 

I have bookmarked your site and will visit more often!

Hope to have helped!

P.S. It still rhymes with 'oath' - but 'oath' is pronounced with a /ɔː/ too.

The only time we come close to pronouncing it as spelled is when ""For"" starts a sentence or is otherwise emphasized.

I have only ever heard it said in such a way as to rhyme with ""oath"" and ""growth"", with the rare exception of any poorly-spoken bogan who pronounces a variety of words badly, whether it be both/boaf, truth/troof, or you/ya.
If the word ""both"" was to be mistakenly pronounced as it is spelt, I could well imagine someone pronouncing it as rhyming with ""cloth"", but to mispronounce it with an ""L"" must be the product of some sort of odd regional dialect.
